        "comment":"My very first Halo game, was not disappointed, got hooked immediately to the franchise and lore. First of all, the way this was written and directed is just amazing. It really puts you in a situation of war, no mercy, no sugarcoating, kill or be killed. The music is basically the cherry on top, incredible composition, my favorite set of themes among the Halo franchise. Second, the story, unlike Master Chief's, make you feel almost weak and helpless.",

I say that because first-person shooter games hit close to home for me and it is BY FAR better than any other first-person shooter games i have played. (MW2 is a close second). It never disappoints, and is very, very nostalgic as the series of Black Ops grew so big that every person loves that game. ",

Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.",

Along with the soundtracks and other background noises like bird song or the whistles of policeman, or the rivers. Rockstar has got this game spot on with this. Nature feels real. The noises of the river and small things like a hoot hoot as an owl flies by, creates such a surreal backdrop. ",
